IT or the if-then instruction is used for checking a condition given in terms of an instruction.

ITTE is ARM's IF-THEN-ELSE instruction and was introduced in the Thumb-2 instruction set.

The above instruction is used for handling groups of conditional code of up to 4 instructions.
The instructions must have the conditional part of there syntax specified. 
These conditions can be logically same or inverse. 

In the wrong code

ITTTE LT
MOV R3

The instrucitons following IT is not conditional as opposed to 

ITTTE LT
ADDLT
MOVLT
MOVLT
SUBGE

where all the instructions after IT are conditional in nature.

This explains the errors.
