a. "Presision" refers to the smallest change that can be represented by "float". 
The fractional part determines the precision of Floating point number, which is called mantissa. 
For example the number 89 can be represented as 	0.089*10^3, 0.890*10^2, 8.900*10^1.
Among the above, the last is more précised since there are three places in the right of the decimal point says that if 
any extra error in actual result like 8.901*10^1, then the error is only 0.011%.

b. Now, normal representations won’t have so many  leadings zero’s. But, the other representation has minimum number in its exponent value 
which leads to more zero’s in its mantissa. For example:0.05 decimal value can be represented in binary by 2 ways:
1. Normal Representation: 1.01*2^-6
2. Other Representation: 0.00101*2^-3

c. IEEE754 standard defines the following five rules:
	i. Rounding to nearest, ties to even: In this method, the real number is rounded off to the nearest even number.
		For example: 5.3 is rounded off to 6.0
	ii. Rounding to nearest, ties away from zero: In this method, the actual number is rounded off to the nearest integer. If the number 
  falls into the middle of two integers, it is rounded to the nearest value above (for positive numbers) and below (for negative numbers).
		For example: 5.3 is rounded off to 5.0
				5.5  is rounded off to 6.0
				-5.5 is rounded off to -6.0
 iii. Round towards zero: In this method the actual number is truncated to the nearest integer while going towards to zero.
	For example: 5.5 is rounded off to 5.0
			5.9 is rounded off to 5.0
			-5.6 is rounded off to -5.0
iv. Round toward positive infinity : In this method the actual number is truncated to the nearest integer while going towards to positive 
infinity.
	For example: 5.5 is rounded off to 6.0
			5.9 is rounded off to 6.0
			-5.6 is rounded off to -5.0
v. Round toward negative infinity : In this method the actual number is truncated to the nearest integer while going towards to zero.
	For example: 5.5 is rounded off to 5.0
			5.9 is rounded off to 5.0
			-5.6 is rounded off to -6.0
